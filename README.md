# SEM1-SA2_TheVendingMachineGame
Summative Assessment 2 for Introduction to Programming

Instructions for launching The Vending Machine:
1. Download the zip file provided in the repository
2. Extract the zip file
3. Upon clicking the extracted folder, click on TheVendingMachineGame.exe (The file type is under 'Application')

Instructions for checking Python coding:
1. Apply the 1st, 2nd and 3rd step (without launching the game) to launching the Vending Machine
2. Click on the 'game' folder to access the codes
3. Most of the files are there as placeholders. The only files (Coding wise) that are relevant to the Summative Assessment is:
  - script.rpy (For the coding itself),
  - custom_screen.rpy (The status menu on the bottom right of the vending machine screen, displaying True or False statements),
  - GUI_screens.rpy (Vending Machine GUI that uses the if/elif/else condition command upon interaction, on par with custom_screen.rpy),
  - custom_script.rpy. (Dialogue, most of the content is irrelevant)

Take note that the files that are fully accessible and readable are the .rpy files NOT the .rpyc files, this one is in charge of executing the code within the game itself.
